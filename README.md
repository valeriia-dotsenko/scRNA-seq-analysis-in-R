# scRNA-seq-analysis-in-R
This is analysis of scRNA seq GSE189636 dataset in R.

Data is published in paper: 	
> Mantri M, Hinchman MM, McKellar DW, Wang MFZ et al. Spatiotemporal transcriptomics reveals pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. Nat Cardiovasc Res 2022 Oct;1(10):946-960. PMID: 36970396

The initial analysis by authors performed in Phyton - https://github.com/madhavmantri/reovirus_induced_myocarditis/blob/main/notebooks/ileum_scRNAseq_processing.ipynb

I reproduced ileum analysis in R:
